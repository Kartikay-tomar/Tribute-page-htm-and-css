        His 24 year-long marvellous cricket career came to an end on 16 November, 2013
        when he announced his retirement. In December 2012, he played his last ODI match
        and in 2013, twenty20 match. Let us tell you that his 200th test match against
        West Indies on 16th November 2013 was his adieu to the cricketing world as a player.

        No doubt Sachin Tendulkar is one of the greatest batsmen in the world. His list
        of records is almost unending. At the age of 16, he became the youngest player
        and till then he continued breaking records and setting new ones. He has inspired
        millions. He had made his position in almost all the hearts of a person in the world.
        It’s like when we talk about cricket the first name that comes to our mind and tongue
        is Sachin only.
